# Welcome to the GENIE tutorial at INSS 2024! 

In this repository you will find some useful instructions on how to install GENIE. 

We have thought of different solutions:
1. **Use a machine with cvmfs installed.** If you have access to a machine with cvmfs mounted (most CERN and FERMILAB machines have it), you can work directly there and simply follow [these instructions](https://github.com/mroda88/GENIE-school/wiki/Installing-GENIE-using-cvmfs). This is the easiest way to have GENIE, so if you have the opportunity to do so, we strongly suggest you stick to this method.
2. **Install directly GENIE on you computer.** This can be done for linux systems and also for Windows after having prepared a Linux environment. All the steps you have to follow are in [this wiki](https://github.com/mroda88/GENIE-school/wiki/Installing-GENIE).
3. **Build a Docker**. If you are a MacBook user and want to install GENIE locally, you need to build a docker image since GENIE does not direcly run on iOS. You can follow this method also for Windows and linux, even if this is not the preferred solution. We have prepared a docker image for you and you can find all [instructions here](https://github.com/mroda88/GENIE-school/tree/main/docker).
